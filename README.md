# EncoderDecoderForLLM
- This repository helps you to keep your private or sensible data safe.

- It works pretty simple: you pass your dataframe, you receive the dataframe with random encryption so you can pass it to the LLM without exposing personal or sensible data.
- Later, you can easily map the output of the LLM and decode with the real values using the mapping variable inside the class.
